Zyrikl is a programming language designed to make HTML look hard. Yup, that's right! No more wrapping tags and over-excessive use of "<" and ">", just plain old keywords. With easy syntax like `echo "Hello, World";`, you can easily add content to your website.

> ## So, how do I start with Zyrikl?

It's easy! Just paste the following HTML code in:
```
<zyrikl>
// Insert Zyrikl here:
</zyrikl>
