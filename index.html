These methods are case-sensitive to identify their method. The method is a way to distinguish between two builders. All capitalized builders are hidden builders, but have visible methods. Lowercase builders actually show on the webpage. They have visible methods as well. Zyrikl is content-based, so any line in the Zyrikl code gets parsed to the compiler.";
